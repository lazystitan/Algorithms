# What is this?

This is a repository for myself to learn, practice, and make some small stuff in rust.

`src/Algorithms` folder contains some implementation of algorithms,`src/language_learn`contains some basic practice when learning rust and some crates, `src/practice` includes some small stuff implemented by rust.

Besides, the `build.rs` in root directory is for learning `cc`. 

# What had I done by now?

## Algorithms Folder

1.  KMP
2.  Boyer Moores match
3.  Rabin Karps match
4.  A search algorithms trait
5.  Some algorithms about prime, including generating prime using sieve method, MR test.
