# What is this?

This is a repository for myself to learn, practice, and make some small stuff in rust.

`src/Algorithms` folder contains some implementation of algorithms,`src/language_learn`contains some basic practice when learning rust and some crates, `src/practice` includes some small stuff implemented by rust.

Besides, the `build.rs` in root directory is for learning `cc`. 

# What had I done by now?

## Algorithms Folder

### string_match
1.  KMP
2.  Boyer Moores match
3.  Rabin Karps match
4.  A search algorithms trait
5.  Some algorithms about prime, including generating prime using sieve method, MR test.
### basic_type
1.  Bag structure, not fully complete
### sort
1.  Insert sort
2.  Select sort
3.  Shell sort
4.  Sort trait for sort algorithms
### math
1.  Sqrt algorithm, not complete


## Language_learn Folder
1.  Macro `include` test
2.  `cc` and `libc` test
3.  Macro practice


## Practice
